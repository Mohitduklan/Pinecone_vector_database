# Pinecone_vector_database
Hands on pinecone, A vector database which uses similarity search to vectors to query DB. 


## An introduction to the Pinecone vector database.
Pinecone makes it easy to build high-performance vector search applications. Itâ€™s a managed, cloud-native vector database with a simple API and no infrastructure hassles.

## Use cases
Pinecone is useful for a broad variety of applications. The following are some of the most common:

- Semantic text search: Convert text data into vector embeddings using an NLP transformer such as a sentence embedding model, then index and search through those vectors using Pinecone.
- Generative question-answering: Retrieve relevant contexts to queries from Pinecone and pass these to a generative model like OpenAI to generate an answer backed by real data sources.
- Hybrid search: Perform semantic and keyword search over your data in one query and combine the results for more relevant results.
- Image similarity search: Transform image data into vector embeddings and build an index with Pinecone. Then convert query images into vectors and retrieve similar images.
- Product recommendations: Generate product recommendations for ecommerce based on vectors representing users.
